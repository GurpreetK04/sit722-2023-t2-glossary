      <tr>
        <td>CI/CD</td>
        <td>A DevOps practice that emphasizes automating the process of integrating code changes into a shared repository (Continuous Integration) and deploying code to production automatically (Continuous Deployment). It enables frequent releases, rapid feedback, and reduces the risk of integration issues.</td>
